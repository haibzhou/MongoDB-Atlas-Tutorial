# MongoDB Atlas Tutorial
This lab provides a quick tutorial on how to get started using MongoDB Atlas

# What is MongoDB Atlas?
Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) is a service that allows you to set up, deploy, and scale a database without worrying about on-premise physical hardware, software updates, and the details of configuring for performance. With DBaaS, a cloud provider does all that for you—and gets you up and running right away.

[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) is a fully-managed cloud database that handles all the complexity of deploying, managing, and healing your deployments on the cloud service provider of your choice (AWS , Azure, and GCP). MongoDB Atlas is the best way to deploy, run, and scale MongoDB in the cloud. With Atlas, you’ll have a MongoDB database running with just a few clicks, and in just a few minutes.
